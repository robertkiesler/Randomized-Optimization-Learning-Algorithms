# Randomized-Optimization-Learning-Algorithms

In this project I implemented 4 randomized learning algorithms to 3 optimization problem domains. 

The primary library used in this assignment was ML-Rose.

The 4 randomized learning algorithms used are:
  1. Randomized Hill Climb
  2. Simulated Annealing
  3. Genetic Algorithm
  4. MIMIC

The 3 problem domains explored were:
  1. Max K Color
  2. N-Queens
  3. Knapsack

The objective of this assignment was to implement the algorithms across the 3 problem domains and tuning for optimization. The second part of this project entailed using the optimal parameters for each algorithm in a neural network and tuning for performance.
